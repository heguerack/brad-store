🔍 When Do You Need Headers Like This?
ts
Copy
Edit
headers: {
Authorization: `Basic ${auth}`,
'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
}
✅ Only when:
You're making HTTP requests using fetch() or Axios

And the target server (API) expects certain headers

🧠 Why is Prisma different?
ts
Copy
Edit
const currentUser = await prisma.user.findFirst({ where: { id } })
You don’t need headers here because:

You're not making an HTTP request

Prisma is a direct database client — it connects to your DB over a socket or HTTP internally (not via REST)

You're running code within your own server (Node.js/Next.js runtime)

So no headers. No Content-Type. No Authorization.

🔄 Comparing Side-by-Side
Action Type Needs Headers? Example
fetch() to external API ✅ Yes PayPal, Stripe, REST APIs
axios.post() to API ✅ Yes If API expects headers
Prisma DB call ❌ No prisma.user.findFirst()
Calling internal functions ❌ No getMyCartAction()
File upload to S3/API ✅ Yes Needs content type, auth, etc.

✅ Axios vs Fetch
When using Axios, it's very similar to fetch — but Axios automatically sets Content-Type: application/json if you send a JS object:

ts
Copy
Edit
axios.post(url, { grant_type: 'client_credentials' }, {
headers: {
Authorization: `Basic ${auth}`,
}
})
In fetch(), you must manually do this:

ts
Copy
Edit
fetch(url, {
method: 'POST',
body: JSON.stringify({ grant_type: 'client_credentials' }),
headers: {
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
Authorization: `Basic ${auth}`,
},
})
But for application/x-www-form-urlencoded, even Axios needs you to manually format the body as a string.

🧨 Summary for You
You're correct:

📌 When you're doing an external POST (like PayPal), you're the one formatting the request to match what they expect.

📌 When using Prisma or internal functions, you're not sending an HTTP request — no headers needed.

Your createOrderAction is just using Prisma and helper functions — totally internal, no headers required.

Let me know if you want to switch your PayPal fetch to Axios and I’ll show you the clean version.
